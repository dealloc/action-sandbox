# Contributing to DungeonRS

Setting up a local development environment requires having [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed.

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dealloc/dungeon_rs.git
    ```
2. Ensure you have the correct toolchain installed, `Rustup` can take care of this for you:
    ```bash
   rustup show
    ```
3. Install additional tools used by `DungeonRS` for linting, analysis etc
    ```bash
   cargo install cargo-bloat cargo-deny typos-cli
    ```
4. Build the `editor`, this should build all dependent crates too
   (replace `<windows/linux/macos>` with the correct OS you're using):
    ```bash
   cargo build -p editor --features editor/<windows/linux/macos>
    ```
5. Run the editor using:
    ```bash
   cargo run -p editor --features editor/<windows/linux/macos>
    ```
The editor should pop up and you can start developing!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DungeonRS has very strict linting to ensure consistent and idiomatic code.

### Linting, spell check and analysis
It's highly recommended running the commands below before opening/updating a PR:
```bash
# Run the formatter to make sure everything is formatted consistently
cargo fmt
# Run Clippy to detect syntax / code smells
cargo lint
# Ensure everything is typed consistently
typos
```
